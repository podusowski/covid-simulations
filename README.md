This COVID-19 simulation is trying to asses how many vaccinated people might
still get infected and die before the immunity system fully kicks in.

Limitations
-----------
There are number of limitations that you should be aware of before interpreting
any of this.

Things that might cause the numbers to be underestimated:

- For the program, a _protected_ (one that cannot be infected) person is
  everyone two weeks after the first dose of the vaccine.

- In many countries, people in the risk groups were prioritized to take the jabs
  first. This means that these people were overrepresented in the vaccinated
  subpopulation.

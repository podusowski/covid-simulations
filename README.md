This COVID-19 simulation tries to asses how many vaccinated people might still
get infected and die before the immunity system fully kicks in.


Limitations
-----------
There are number of limitations that you should be aware of before interpreting
any of this.

Things that might cause the numbers to be underestimated:

- For the program, a _protected_ (one that cannot be infected) person is
  everyone two weeks after the first dose of the vaccine.

- In many countries, people in the high risk groups were prioritized to take
  the jabs first, making them overrepresented in the vaccinated subpopulation.
  This might paradoxically mean that the vaccinated subpopulation is
  **at first**, more susceptible to severe complication.
